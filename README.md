TopHN
=====
[TopHN][TOPHN] is a website that aims to recommend exactly one story from
[Hacker News][HN] to you.


Introduction
------------
Say you have got only enough time in a day to read just one story from Hacker
News. What is that story going to be? [TopHN][TOPHN] tries to answer that
question for you.

The top story on Hacker News is sampled every minute. The story that
occurred most frequently in these samples in the last 24 hours is
recommended to you.

What if you missed the top story yesterday, or the day before yesterday, or the
one last weekend? We have got that covered on [the archive page][ARCHIVE].

Hope you like the website and visit it on your busy days.
